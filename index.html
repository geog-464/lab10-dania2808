			<p> Q2 - styleAll is first creating a variable called 'styles' which creates the markers, after in the if statement its saying 'if the geometry type within the argument feature is equal to 'point', then give a specific color, size, opacity to the base markers that were created in the variable 'styles'.</p>
			<p> Q4 - Feature has the information of each data point, layer is the style of your map elements </p>
			<p> Q5 - getLatLng() is a method that will return a value and layer.options.fill is boolean you can tell it to fill a path with color by using true or false arguments.</p>
			<p> Q6 - The radius of the circular markers is bigger and there is no color inside the circle (that was setting layer.option.fill to false did)</p>DANIA TOMAS IANNARONE
